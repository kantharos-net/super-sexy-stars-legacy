# Super Sexy Stars

Small game that started as a group joke. Now its more serious than ever. :D

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.8.x

[Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) version 1.9.x

There is a known Pygame issue with OS X El Capitan and newer. Because of different versions of SDL_image library, images rendered in a Pygame application look corrupted. The workaround is to downgrade to an older version of SDL_image library. See instructions here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/35385411
